Hi, I'm **Sam Hirst** — a Ph.D. candidate in Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida.

🧬 I study **evolutionary genomics**, **functional trait evolution**, and **venom**, using island populations of rattlesnakes as a model system to test ecological and evolutionary theory. My work integrates **whole-genome sequencing**, **transcriptomics**, **ddRADseq**, **proteomics**, and advanced **statistical modeling** to explore how ecological factors shape functional trait evolution. 

💻 I develop reproducible workflows using **R**, **Python**, and **shell/Bash scripting**, with experience in **Unix/Linux environments** for high-throughput data processing and bioinformatics pipeline development.

🌍 My research is grounded in principles of **Island Biogeography Theory** and **trait coevolution**, with a strong emphasis on **fieldwork** and **computational biology**.

🧪 I'm passionate about **open science**, **mentorship**, and bridging **basic research** with real-world applications.

## 💻 Experience

I've been building and applying bioinformatics pipelines since 2018 to investigate key questions in **genomics** and **ecology**. Much of my work bridges field biology with computational science, integrating multi-omic datasets in natural populations to study evolutionary processes in non-model organisms.

## 📂 Repositories

My research primarily uses existing tools and pipelines to investigate ecological and evolutionary questions using diverse molecular datasets. These include:

- 🧬 **Long-read HiFi genome assemblies**
- 🧪 **Short-read genomic data** (e.g., ddRADseq, WGS, sequence capture)
- 🧫 **Transcriptomics**
- 💉 **Proteomics** (e.g., RP-HPLC venom profiles)

Although most of my work centers on analysis using established bioinformatics software, I occasionally develop **custom Python scripts** to build workflows, reformat datasets, or bridge tools that weren’t originally designed to talk to each other.
