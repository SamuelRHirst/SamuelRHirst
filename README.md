Hi, I'm **Sam Hirst** — a Ph.D. candidate in Integrative Biology at the University of South Florida.

 I study evolutionary genomics, functional trait evolution, and venom, using island populations of rattlesnakes as a model system to test ecological and evolutionary theory. My work integrates whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomics, ddRADseq, proteomics, and advanced statistical modeling to explore how ecological factors shape functional trait evolution. 

 I develop reproducible workflows using R, Python, and shell/Bash scripting, with experience in Unix/Linux environments for high-throughput data processing and bioinformatics pipeline development.

 My research is grounded in principles of Island Biogeography Theory and trait coevolution, with a strong emphasis on fieldwork and computational biology.

 I'm passionate about open science, mentorship, and bridging basic research with real-world applications.

##  Experience

I've been building and applying bioinformatics pipelines since 2018 to investigate key questions in genomics and ecology. Much of my work bridges field biology with computational science, integrating multi-omic datasets in natural populations to study evolutionary processes in non-model organisms.

##  Repositories

My research primarily uses existing tools and pipelines to investigate ecological and evolutionary questions using diverse molecular datasets. These include:

-  Long-read HiFi genome assemblies
-  Short-read genomic data (e.g., ddRADseq, WGS, sequence capture)
-  Transcriptomics
-  Proteomics (e.g., RP-HPLC venom profiles)

Although most of my work centers on analysis using established bioinformatics software, I occasionally develop custom Python scripts to build workflows, reformat datasets, or bridge tools that weren’t originally designed to talk to each other.

###  Repositories by Data Type

| Data Type       | Description                                                                 | Repository |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| HiFi Genome Assembly & Annotation | HiFi genome assembly and annotation | [`HiFi_Genome_Assembly_and_Annotation`](https://github.com/SamuelRHirst/HiFi_Genome_Assembly_and_Annotation) |
| Transcriptomics | RNA-seq preprocessing, quantification, differential expression              | [`Transcriptomics`](https://github.com/SamuelRHirst/Transcriptomics) |
| Custom Scripts  | Helper functions and file converters written in Python or Bash              | [`Custom_Scripts`](https://github.com/SamuelRHirst/Custom_Scripts) |

Stay tuned as I build these out and share them publicly!
