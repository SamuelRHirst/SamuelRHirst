Hi, I'm **Sam Hirst** — a Ph.D. candidate in Biology at the University of South Florida.

🧬 I study **evolutionary genomics**, **functional trait evolution**, and **venom biology**, using island-dwelling rattlesnakes as a model system to test ecological and evolutionary theory. My work integrates **whole-genome sequencing**, **transcriptomics**, **RADseq**, **proteomics**, and advanced **statistical modeling** to explore how biodiversity shapes—and is shaped by—genomic and phenotypic evolution.

💻 I develop reproducible workflows using **R**, **Python**, and **shell/Bash scripting**, with extensive experience in **Unix/Linux environments** for high-throughput data processing and bioinformatics pipeline development.

🌍 My research is grounded in principles of **Island Biogeography Theory** and **trait coevolution**, with a strong emphasis on **fieldwork**, **computational biology**, and **science communication**.

🧪 I'm passionate about **open science**, **mentorship**, and bridging **basic research** with real-world applications—like how venom evolution can inform drug discovery.

## 💻 Experience

I've been building and applying bioinformatics pipelines since 2018 to investigate key questions in **genomics**, **ecology**, and **biostatistics**. Much of my work bridges field biology with computational science, integrating multi-omic datasets to study evolutionary processes in non-model organisms.
